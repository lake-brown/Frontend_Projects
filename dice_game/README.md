## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

This game simulates rolling two dice â€” one for Player 1 and one for Player 2.  
Each time the page is refreshed, the dice images change to show a random number from 1 to 6.  
The game then displays the winner (Player 1, Player 2, or Draw) based on which dice rolled the higher number.

## ðŸ’» How It Works

- Two random numbers between 1 and 6 are generated.
- The dice images update to match the rolled numbers.
- The heading (`<h1>`) updates to declare the winner or a draw.
